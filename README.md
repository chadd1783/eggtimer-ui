eggtimer
==============

Ionic app to track menstrual periods.


Development
-----------

This project is a work in progress, and very rough at the moment. I am currently in the process of
porting over UI functionality from:
https://github.com/jessamynsmith/eggtimer-server

Remote debugging Android:
 - In developer options, enable USB debugging
 - On computer, in chrome, go to chrome://inspect/
 - On phone, allow debugging
